He was born on October 21 in the year of 1695.  A secular cleric, he was ordained a priest on the Penticostal Sabath in the year 1719, and after six years as a parish priest in his homeland, he joined the Company of Jesus on October 9, 1725, in which he served with fervor.  It followed that he came to the missions of the Indies in the year 1729.  He arrived first at the Mission of Carichiqui, where he was sent by his superiors in the year 1731.  After two years as the missionary there, he was sent by the Provincial Father, at the request of the Most Illustrious Señor Don Martín de Lisacoechea, Bishop of Durango, to the Pimería Alta and the new Mission of San Xavier del Bac. There, envious of his declaration of the glory of God and his faith in Jesus Christ, the Devil counseled the Indian witch doctors (hechiceros) to kill him.  Though they tried on three occasions, it followed that they were unable to do so.  God preserved him with His singular providence through the medium of Padre Agustín de Campos, and although he was cleansed of the witchcraft he remained injured all of his life.  The three malefactors came to an unfortunate end: one was was overcome by the Devil; another quickly fell dead; and the third was killed by his own family.  In the year 1736 he obediently entered the Mission of San Ignacio, which was nearly devoid of people because of the continuous epidemics of small pox and measles and mass movements of the people.  However, through his Holy Zeal and unbounded charity, he repopulated the three towns from the Papaguería.  Indeed, there were ten families here when he arrived and there are more than a hundred families now at his death.  He manifested the same zeal in gathering souls for God.  Upon his arrival as a new missionary he breathed and succored everything necessary for the maintenance and subsistance of the missions.  In short, he is credited with being a father to the poor and a great giver of alms.

He heard the screams, but having no reason to believe otherwise, assumed it was the people of Magdalena. Arriving there he asked about the already dead person, but no one was able to provide any information.  So, they all left together in search of him, and found him dead with two lance wounds, naked and scalped.  They brought [the body] to the said Mission and those of this Mission of San Ignacio were notified.  From here the natives went and retrieved the body.

This will serve as my request to Your Honor to receive the information and this presentation that I am a single man and unencumbered by any other marriage.  I request Your Honor hear my plea and ask that it be received as information of my freedom from any marriage obligation, that I might obtain your undivided mercy and justice.

For my part, the foregoing has been presented and the applicant’s promised information, given in sufficient form, has been received, and these writings have been forwarded to y notary public in the Royal Presidio of Santa Rosa de Corodéguachi, Don Manuel Josef de Sosa, so that they can be properly recorded. I went to the house and abode of Señor Capitán Vitalicio Don Juan Bautista de Anza and heard and received his declaration that his daughter, Doña María de Anza, is single and consenting to this marriage. I recorded the information that she is single and free from any marriage obligation, in the said legal form, in view of the witnesses who were also interrogated. In the same form, the three customary and necessary banns were published, and all signed in the presence of the aforementioned notary. In good faith:
	Pedro Verdugo del Castillo (rubric)

On the seventh day of the month of April in the said year, the said notary, having published the banns without the precise documentation for the said marriage, went personally to the house of Doña María de Anza, from whom I received the customary legal oath, under which she promised to answer truthfully the questions asked. She said that she had contracted marriage with Don Josef Antonio Romo de Vivar. Asked if this had come about because of coercion or violence on the part of any person, she responded that it was with all her heart and free will, and that she was not coerced by anyone. I therefore determined that what she said was true and legally recorded the information given, which she affirmed and ratified.  She said that she is sixteen years of age but did not sign because she does not know how. Therefore, I, the said notary, sign for her in good faith.

On April 13, 1734, the said marriage performed with the assistance of Señor Bachiller Don Juan Josef de Grijalva, priest, vicar, and ecclesiastic judge for His Majesty and official of the holy office of the inquisition for the capital of Sonora, San Juan.  In virtue of the license I granted him, the said official performed the marriage, for which truth I sign as above in good faith.

They eased off Father Visitor Jacobo Sedelmayer and Father Nentvig, who diverted them [the Pimas] with an adobe they threw.  The Fathers were of the Company of Jesus. They burned churches and houses and sacrilegiously profaned the sacred vessels, ornaments, paintings of the saints, and the statuary. They destroyed property in homes and in the fields. The head of the uprising was a Pima, Luis, of the village of Saric. It is unspeakable what happened in this uprising. It was caused by the Governor and Captain General, Don Diego Ortiz Parilla, who gave the cane of authority of Captain General (never before used in the Pimería Alta) to his puppet, the said Luis, forming his company of Pimas and patronizing the Indian's pride to such excess that the Royal Arms were trampled when the war hit and was promoted against the loyal subjects of the Crown with the contempt that Luis and his chiefs brought about, protecting the insurgents and telling them that killing Spanish Fathers, burning and robbing churches, etc., was not a crime. Indeed, the Lord Governor promoted and rewarded him so much that he, himself, succeeded in approving the uprising, and though he was discreet, added to what has been said. Furthermore, the said Lord Governor not only helped the insurrection by supporting his companion, Luis, with the cane of Captain General, but he honored and courted him and handed the Pimería over to his discretion, leaving the dead unburied, the chalices defiled, and making cigar holders of the consecrated oil vials and sweat room trinkets of the ornaments and saints. Finally, he was in San Ignacio, situated on the frontier of the Pimería Alta, with more than 300 armed men but, although he pardoned his companion, Luis, and provided sanctuary for the fugitive in the house of the Father, he had no intentions of leaving for the front as Governor and Captain General of the armed soldiers, rather dedicating his valor only to the rear guard. For these truths I sign on May 30, 1753.

The body was ""shrouded"" in the habit of ""Nuestro Padre San Xavier."" He died from the epedimic of an unnamed desease that was killing ""an infinite number of people in Sonora."" Thinking that he was going to died he dictated the following on March 21st:        (folio 10v) ""Be it known that this letter of designation of testator is dictated by me, Don Gregorio Álvarez Tuñón y Quirós, resident of this province of Sonora and native of the city of Valladolid in the kingdom of Castilla. I am the legitimate son of Don Juan Álvarez Tuñón, deceased, and Doña Andrea Ruiz, who were residents of the said city. I am sick but of good memory and understanding, and believing as I do in the highest mystery of the Most Holy Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and in a divine essence, and in everything that is had and believed by Our Holy Mother Roman Apostolic Catholic Church: I say that due to the severity (f.11) of my sickness I am unable to execute a last will and testament.  Therefore, I have confessed, for the relief of my conscience, to Reverend Father Juan de Echagoyen, professed religious of the Holy Company of Jesus, minister and missionary of the jurisdiction of Aconchi in this province of Sonora, a person in whom I have total trust and satisfaction. Therefore, I agree to give my complete power of attorney and sufficient rights as required, or that will be necessary, to the aforementioned Reverend Father Juan de Echagoyen, so that at whatever time he should desire, provided I have died as assumed by law number thirty-three, he should make and arrange my will, in which he will be able to provide donations and legal business piously and graciously as he should desire, and all other good commerce that I would be able to and would do, as I felt it should be done for good. I approve and ratify from now (f.11v) until then, and it is my will that he keep and complete it as I would have done and we have agreed.  If I should die from this sickness that I have, I leave instructions that my body should be interred in the parochial church of the Real de San Juan Bautista in the part and place where the will and disposition of my executors dictates, as well as other arrangements for the type of funeral and burial. I hereby name as my executors the above mentioned Reverend Father Echagoyen, the Bachiller Don Juan Joseph de Grijalva, priest and beneficiary of this province of Sonora and agent of the Holy Inquisition, and the Bachiller Don Juan Ignacio Rogriguez Soto, presbyter and inhabitant of this bishopric and lieutenant priest and vicar of the Real de San Juan Bautista, to whom I jointly give complete power to execute and complete what is contained in, and should be contained in this writing and testament.  By virtue of what I wish to be done, I leave the (f.12) remainder of my goods to, and name as heirs to equal parts, Doña Ana Victorina Álvarez Tuñón y Quirós and Doña Martina Álvarez Tuñón y Quirós, my legitimate daughters by Doña María Margarita Ortiz Cortez, my now deceased wife. I hereby revoke and annul whatever testaments, codicils, or powers that may have been made and agreed to before this power of attorney, because none have any value except this, the last testament that my said executors made in my name, all of which I desire to be kept and complied with in that method and form which rightfully should be had. In testimony of the same and for the validation and stability of the same, I ask and supplicate Captain Don Nicolás de la Torre y Murga, lieutenant general of the alcalde mayor and captain of war for the kingdom, etc., to confirm it by his authority and judicial decree. (f.12v) The said lieutenant general, whom I am presently with, said that he would interpose and confirm what I am owed and what I owe and, moreover, what my rights are. The said authorizing party, appearing to be in sincere accord, swore that he understood, and he agreed and signed with me, in concurrence with the principals of which he acted as receiving judge with those of his assisting staff, there being no public or royal scribe on this frontier to carry out the law. Witnesses to this agreement, residents of this jurisdiction who were called and implored for the same, were Captain Antonio Ortiz Cortez, Don Salvador de Figueroa, and Don Francisco Felix de Corella. It is written on this common paper, because no sealed paper is to be had, supplied by the ordinary royal justice of this province.

But I believe she is a Yuma [Indian] from her form of speech. Her age is about twenty-four years. I gave her the name of María Loreto and the surname of Madorran.

He swore under oath <br> (folio 2v; frame 695-left) <br> regarding the first question that he had read that it is true that Pedro Claudio, his Mulatto slave, was married to the deceased Petronila de Jesús as certified in the books administered by the lord priest. In answer to what is written in the second interrogatory he responded that the said deceased person became sick with the disease from which she died at the home and in the company of her mother, which is well-known public information, over which he did not have, nor does he now have any power, because she was independent of his authority. Upon seeing the third question he responded that the said deceased person, before she was married, worked for him for some five years at a wage adjusted for Indians, of which nothing was left owing. Before the time of the wedding, however, the said deceased person owed him, of which nothing was ever paid. At the time she was married she was free and in charge of her own will because, although she entered and left the home of the declarer, it was for the reason that she was the wife of his slave whom she lived with.  This is well-known and public information. Upon leaving this person she was living with, she said to his slave that she was going in search of someone to supply food for her because she had no one to feed her. For several days she provided food for her husband, and this was without living by consent in the house of the declarer. The Mulatto slept at the house of the declarer for his own convenience. In answer to the last question he said that it is certain and true that he went charitably to see the lord priest to have the said deceased person buried as a poor person because her mother had asked for church alms.  The Mulatto could not go because he was at home, since the declarer was the one obliged to go see the lord priest. This is the truth according to the oath that he made, and having read it, he confirmed that it is his declaration and ratified it.  It is further added that in reference to what occurred, the expressed (page torn away) of one year of marriage, saying that he did not go to provide food for his wife. He responded that because of that, she was in charge of her own will, the <br> (folio 3; frame 695-right) <br> precedent being set by her bringing food to her husband all those days. This declaration was made in the house of the declarer. He declared that he is sixty-four years of age and he signed with me, the notary, which I hereby certify. <br> Don Martín de Inza (rubric) <br> Joseph Andres de Aragón (rubric), Notary Public <br><br> Decree <br> In the City of Durango on the 24th day of the month of April in the year 1730, Lord Doctor Don Manuel Sebastian Cano, Governor, Judge, Purveyor, and Vicar General and Ordinary of Testaments, Chaplaincies, and Pious Works, and Examiner of Curates and Confessors in this Bishopric of the New Kingdom of Vizcaya for the Most Illustrious Lord Doctor Don Benito Crespo of the Order of Saint James by the grace of God, and of the Holy Apostolic See, Bishop of this said Bishopric of the Council of His Majesty, etc. <br> My Lord: <br> Having seen the preceding answer given under oath by Bachiller Don Martín de Inza, Presbyter, and in reference to the circumstances therein, it is apparent that the deceased Petrona de Jesús, who was the wife of his Mulatto slave, worked for him for five years before they got married and she slept many nights at his house after the marriage. He certifies for His Lordship that it was he, the said Bachiller, who arranged for the marriage of the above mentioned couple and who gave his permission and paid the corresponding fees. Concerning the fees of the present notary, as with all others prescribed by His Lordship, <br> (folio 3v;  frame 696-left) <br> in consequence of these same circumstances and those that must be put in execution currently in every case: It must be declared, and His Lordship declares, that the said Bachiller Don Martín de Inza must promptly pay the eighteen pesos and four tomines of the parochial fees for the burial of the said Petronila de Jesús that brought about this claim. In conformance with this it should be ordered, and His Lordship did order, that I provide notification that the payment should be effectively collected. In case of default the administrative high constable shall commence debt collection in accordance with what is right. Payment will be executed if he has to request, make a plea, or allege. It will be done in the ordinary way. Justice will be heard and maintained in whatever form it should have to take.  If, to accomplish such, testimony should be asked for, the present notary will give it to all authorities that need it, in the public form and manner required. His Lordship so provided, ordered, and signed. <br> Don Manuel Sebastian Cano (rubric) <br> Before me: Joseph Andres de Aragón (rubric), Notary Public <br><br> Notification <br> In the City of Durango on the 13th day of the month of May in the year 1730, I, the undersigned notary, made known <br> (folio 4;  frame 696-right) <br>
read, and provided notification of the foregoing decree, as a bill of collection, to Bachiller Don Martín de Inza, Presbyter, in such a way that he understood the expression and contents of the said decree.  In regard to it, he said it is not justified, whether he owes it or not, to pay as though it were not owed by others, speaking of the alms. He appeals the decree of His Lordship before whoever will hear it, and he does it by the rights allowing him to be able to do so. I testify of it and he gave this as his answer and signed it. <br><br> Don Martín de Inza (rubric) <br> Joseph Andres de Aragón (rubric), Notary Public <br><br> Decree <br> In the City of Durango on the 16th day of the month of May in the year 1730, Lord Doctor Don Manuel Sebastian Cano Governor, Judge, Purveyor, and Vicar General and Ordinary of Testaments, Chaplaincies, and Pious Works, and Examiner of Curates and Confessors in this Bishopric of the New Kingdom of Vizcaya for the Most Illustrious Lord Doctor Don Benito Crespo of the Order of Saint James by the grace of God, and of the Holy Apostolic See, Bishop of this said Bishopric of the Council of His Majesty, etc. <br> My Lord: <br> In view of the answer given by Bachiller Don Martín de Inza, Presbyter, His Lordship said, notwithstanding the response, that the present notary should go and return, accompanied by the commissioned administrative high constable of this tribunal, to notify the aforementioned Bachiller of the value of eighteen pesos and four tomines for the burial that is demanded and in default of punctual execution.  The said high constable is to attach goods equal to the current amount and seize them in accordance with his right to do so, publish the results, and sell them for <br> (folio 4v;  frame 697) <br> the highest and best bid.  He will then charge the debt to the amount received and, after the ten days required by law, deliver the said amount to the rector priest of the Cibary of this Holy Church.  He will provide testimony as requested for whoever needs it in the aftermath of the above mentioned appeal. In the appointed time the said priest will have his claim. It was so provided, ordered, and signed by His Lordship. <br> (faded, illegible signature and rubric) <br> Before me: Joseph Andres de Aragón (rubric), Notary Public <br><br> Certification <br> Joseph Andres de Aragón, Notary Public of the Episcopal Court of the City of Durango, certifies and declares in truthful testament concerning what was wanting and owed, and no more, that he went to the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Guadalupe that is outside the walls of this city, accompanied by Joseph Ignacio Moreno, tribunal constable of this Episcopal Court, where he made known, read, and gave notification of the preceding decree to Bachiller Don Martín de Inza, Presbyter Chaplain of the said sanctuary, in person. Having understood it, he wanted to expand on his previous response, in that he was unable to provide for the execution of the said decree.  In conformance with that statement he said that he has no pesos nor goods with which to make the payment of the eighteen and a half that is demanded. He was told twice to show his goods. Each time he responded that he had none.  This testimony is given of what had to be asked to bring about closure and, although insistence was made, cooperation was not received and neither the payment nor seizure of goods was accomplished. I certify it to be so and provide this as evidence of my completion of my obligation. In the said sanctuary on the (page torn away) of June in the year 1730. <br> I here sign in testimony of truth <br>Joseph Andres de Aragón (rubric), Notary public",3/1/1730

183 - Juana, married in the land of the gentiles, Papago, died<br>On June 24, 1826, I, Friar Faustino Gonzales, privately baptized a female Papago who was married in the land of the gentiles and I gave her the name Juana. <br>Friar Faustino Gonzales (rubric)<br><br>184 - Jesús, of gentile parents, Papago, died<br>On the said day, month, and year I solemnly baptized a child, the son of gentile parents. I gave him the name Jesús, for which I certify and for whom the godmother was Magdalena Galindo, and Indian of the village. I signed. <br> Friar Faustino Gonzales (rubric) <br><br>185 - Guadalupe, of gentile parents, Papago, died<br>On the same day, month, and year I solemnly baptized a child, the daughter of gentile parents and her godparents were Lucio Parra and his wife, Gertrudis Sevilla, residents of the said village. I gave her the name Guadalupe. <br> Fray Faustino Gonzales (rubric) <br><br>186 - José Martín, married in the land of the gentiles, Papago, died<br>On June 25, 1826 I baptized first a Papago Indian who was married in the land of the gentiles and was sick with the measles. He was instructed in the best manner permitted by his illness. I gave him the name José Martín. <br> In certification, Friar Faustino Gonzales (rubric)<br>Having seen the disposition and the admirable will of the gentile Papagos to have their children receive baptism during this measles epidemic, and seeing that the same disease affects the adults who, at any time of the day or night, call upon the Father at Caborca, where most of the Papagos were coming to realize they would die, the majority having made the determination to go to their water holes and the hills of the saguaros, and knowing there were a lot of sick people in the village of Pitiquito, I came here in the evening of San Juan’s feast day, June 23rd of this year of 1826.  Then, with a good interpreter I went to their huts and spoke with them about it.  In consideration of what motivated me to move from Caborca, which was only to try to keep them from dying and losing their souls, I went to praise God for the signs they gave in indication of a desire for baptism, having seen by their reasonings that they had substantially understood all that is necessary.  Indians of all ages who were healthy but expecting to catch the measles yearned for baptism for themselves and their little children, and both adults and children fell to their knees. I baptized the four mentioned above, who died in the three days that I was there, privately and according to their good disposition – the children as well as the adults – because it was probable that most of them would die while being without rational help for such a dangerous disease, and they were eating saguaro fruit, … , and things that are beneficial to life in their natural state. Because of this and the desire they had shown some years back to gather to the missions, it is a great relief to see them now baptized. With the good dispositions they have shown, it will help the Fathers in remedying the scandals and disorders that have resulted from not observing these laws that are so necessary to mandate, if the Lord will prepare the government to have the zeal to punish inconsiderate men so that they will not say anything else to spread among the Indians that none of the Fathers can do or have to do outside the church.  The Indians have always seen the missions through the Fathers. These tongues, to which the Indians listen to the conclusion that liberty and equality reign, and that they are citizens – something that takes years – should never be heard by these Indians. And, it gets worse each day. The Indians have no respect for the Fathers, nor their rules, nor the churches.  Then, unfortunately the common citizen is no greater than the Indians in doctrine, nor in vices, and they are the ones whose example the Indians follow, acting like the ones who are most daring. Nevertheless, the time will come when they will have to take advantage of the occasion when they are ready to look to the Father for grace. I baptized the following, whom I thought best to record in this book of baptisms, and then those who die or live can be recorded in the margins:<br><br>1. María Juana, married<br>2.

I have labored no little amount in constructing a good church with all its necessary adornments, and a good house. Now,when it is possible to promise me some rest and enjoyment from one and the other, I see the need to leave it and ask that Your Most Illustrious Lord favor me with the chaplaincy of the Hospital of Arizpe. <br>I do this, Most Illustrious Lord, because I have two sisters in Spain who have need of my assistance so that they do not have to work so much. I think with this wage,  although it is small, I will be able to assist in this necessity. The Lord Priest of this Capital (Arizpe), Don José Salcido, has promised me some assistance by my helping him with the administration of his parish and teaching grammar to many little boys and girls, children of the principal residents who have rendered themselves capable of mastering it. I have no desire to cause any misunderstanding, but this is how it appears to me. I will leave nothing lacking in the Pimería Alta because any one of the three fathers, whom I have received notice, are already on their way from the College, will be able to occupy my place better than I did, when they find it with an all new church and house and all the other things that are in progress. <br>This, Most Illustrious Lord, is what I have to tell and to request from Your Most Illustrious Lordship.  As always, I am resigned to accept what you decide, as Your Most Illustrious Lordship knows better than I what is best for the honor and glory of God, Our Lord, and for the good of souls. <br>If Your Most Illustrious Lordship comes here, and agrees and sees fit to honor my request, I will ask that my affiliation with the College be discontinued and that I be assigned to the Province. <br>God Our Lord keep the important life of Your Most Illustrious Lordship for the good of this Bishopric for the years that your most faithful and minor subject desires. <br>Cocóspera, February 20, 1800. <br>Friar Juan de Santisteban (rubric) <br>Most Illustrious and Reverend Lord Don Friar Francisco Rouset de Jesús",2/20/1800

This was due to no minister having been provided by the Reverend Father President for the mission I occupied (1), because the College of the Holly Cross had not received word of my disaffiliation. Today, Father Friar Joaquín Goitia, who delivered Your Most Illustrious Lordship’s orders to me, communicating the same authority that I had from the President, is at the said mission. <br>          On the cited 8th of August, Your Most Illustrious Lordship gave me the same authority with respect to the hospital that I had for the presidio (2), except for marriage presentations.

Gercke, D.D., officiating<br>10 A.M., February 21, 1935<br>San Xavier Mission<br><br>Tumacácori National Monument Custodian Louis R. Caywood wrote the following report about the proceedings: <br><br>On the morning of February 21, 1935, at 8:00 a.m. at the Mission of San José de Tumacácori mass was said by Rev. Francis Bree over the mortal remains of two pioneer Franciscan priests who long ago trod the desert valleys of this region working among the Indians. Following this brief mass the remains of Padre Baltazar Carillo and Padre Narciso Gutiérrez were escorted by three National Park Service men over the long 40-mile trek from San José de Tumacácori to San Xavier del Bac near Tucson, Arizona. Many times had these padres made the long trip by foot or horseback but that day they were taken over the same route to their last resting place. <br>The arrival at San Xavier might well bring to mind the arrival of these same priests in early days. Indians were stationed on the hill to the right of the Mission and upon sight of the procession were seen running down the hill to tell others of the arrival. <br>But this time hundreds of people including high prelates of the Catholic Church, Franciscan brothers, nuns of two Catholic sisterhoods (St. Josephs and Immaculate Heart), and many townspeople were here to welcome back these old Padres to the Mission which was once theirs. Two prelates of the church – Most Rev. Daniel J. Gercke, D.D., Bishop of Tucson, and Most Rev. Edmund Gibbons, D.D., Bishop of Albany, N.Y. – joined with modern Franciscans in honoring the two pioneers. <br>The National Park Service men, Walter G. Attwell, Associate Engineer, Gene H. Gordon, Assistant Engineer, and Louis R. Caywood, Park Ranger, assisted by Mayor Henry O. Jaasted of Tucson escorted the bodies to the gates of the Mission where they were replaced by the Franciscan brothers, - the action significant of the transfer from the custody of the Federal Government back to that of the order in whose service the pioneers had labored. The bodies were placed before the Sanctuary where the services took place. <br>As the bodies passed down the Nave to the Altar a Franciscan choir sang the age-old Gregorian chant of the mass and burial service, a composition that has been used in the Church for more than 800 year. On the plain black casket resting outside the sanctuary rail were placed the symbols of priesthood – the golden chalice, the stole and missal. The casket was flanked on either side by burning tapers. Three veteran Franciscan missionaries of Arizona assisted at the solemn requiem mass which lasted almost an hour. <br>Father Pudlowski preached the sermon which paid high tribute to these early Franciscan missionaries. Mention, of course, was made of the Jesuits who preceded and in reality laid the foundation for the Franciscans. The Jesuits had been expelled after their long and arduous labors by Charles III of Spain in 1767. The Franciscans took over the work started by the earlier order. They went into the field in order to save the missions from the complete disintegration which threatened them. <br>Padre Baltazar and Padre Narciso were not among the pioneers but followed in about five years, and labored in the field for almost a quarter of a century. From 1780 until 1794 Padre Baltazar Carillo was superior at San Xavier. In 1795 he died and Padre Narciso Gutiérrez took his place until 1799. The first gave 24 years of service and the second 20-odd. Father Pudlowski, on behalf of the order, thanked Bishop Gercke and Bishop Gibbons and the representatives of the Federal Government for enabling the Franciscans to bring the bodies of their pioneers back to their home mission. <br>Bishop Gercke, in his sermon, paid high tribute to the early padres, after speaking of their lives and work among the Indians, he said: “Today they have come back home to rest under the shadow of this mission they built and loved so well. <br>“The history of the missionary work of the Franciscans brings us back over a period of nearly 400 years, for only 47 years after Columbus set foot in America, Padre Marcus de Niza came to what is now Arizona.” <br>Following the sermon and mass, Bishop Gercke donned black vestments and, wearing the mitre of the hierarchy, descended from the sanctuary to bless the bodies of the pioneers with incense and holy water. <br> Finally, a procession was formed at the Altar headed by a Franciscan cross-bearer, followed by the Franciscans, bishops, priests, Park Service men and nuns who all escorted the bodies to the Mortuary Chapel just outside the Mission. There the grave in the floor was blessed before the remains of the Franciscan pioneers were laid to rest in heir final resting place. <br> We, of the Park Service, who took part in the Procession from Tumacácori to San Xavier and the services following were much impressed by the sincerity and deep regard which the brothers showed during the elaborate requiem mass. <br><br>Archaeologist Paul Beaubien had the following to say about the excavation of the two Padres’ bones: <br><br>On December 15, 1934, I arrived at Tumacácori National Monument, Arizona, to take charge of an FERA project instituted to uncover certain ruined buildings adjacent to the present mission. The walls and special features such as benches, furnaces, etc., were to be mapped by National Park Service engineers, after which the soil was to be replaced as found. Such maps would be of significance in the formulation of possible future landscaping or partial restoration plans. Moreover, it was hoped that some of the blurred chapters of Tumacácori’s history would become more legible….Because the present mission is the central structure from which all others must be located, it seems advisable to begin a description of the excavation there. At the outset, no work inside was contemplated but a series of unforeseen factors developed which led to some investigation. First, the Franciscan Order wished to have the bodies of two priests exhumed from the sanctuary for removal to San Xavier…. The two fathers to be removed were Fathers Balthazar Carrillo and Narciso Gutierrez. In 1784, Carrillo was in charge at Guevavi, and moved with the mission to Tumacácori. He died in 1795. Gutierrez, who succeeded him, died December 13, 1821. Mr. Frank Pinkley has a copy of a burial record which states the bodies of the two priests were taken from an old church and buried in a new, December 13, 1822. <br>On December 31, 1934, a party from the headquarters of the Southwestern Monuments, with Father Vincent of San Xavier, arrived to move the bodies again. On their arrival, I sent for one of the FERA laborers, Augustine Cardial, who has witnessed some of the vandalism at the Monument. According to Cardial, a party, headed by the superintendent of a mine in Mexico, had dug a treasure hunting hole, fifteen feet deep, where Carrillo and Gutierrez were said to have been buried. The party had found the bones of two adults. When refilling all the bones were tossed back into the hole, except one skull kept for a souvenir. Cardial’s story was supported by all evidence unearthed. <br>In Father Vincent’s presence, a six-foot hole was dug and no bones were found, but another try was made a few days later. At a depth of seven and a half feet, the jumbled parts of two adult skeletons were found, associated with pieces of plaster, bricks, and other debris typical of treasure hunting holes. I removed the four femurs, three of which were the only long bones unbroken, the fragments of one skull, and about half the smaller bones. Then having something else to do, I let two laborers remove the other bones. No pieces of coffin or cloth were found. Of course, the treasure hunters would have taken any beads, crucifix, or coffin ornaments. <br>The bones were darker in color and much more fragile than any others found in the church. Also large mastoidian processes on the one skull indicated it was a male. I sincerely believe they were the bones of the two Fathers thrown back in a treasure hunting hole. <br>The bones were reburied at San Xavier, February, 1935.",2/21/1935

Pedro Ceballos<br><br>Number 58<br>Most Excellent Sir: <br>On this date the following setter was directed to the Most Excellent Lord Secretary of State and the Universal Office of Grace and Justice, Don José Antonio Caballero: <br>""Most Excellent Sir - One of my primary concerns from the time I first took charge of these dominions was to introduce and spread the fluid vaccine to protect the inhabitants from the natural smallpox that invades them on such frequent intervals as to always keep the memory of its devastation fresh on their minds."" <br>""With this object in mind I brought with me from Veracruz Professor Don Alejandro Arboleya carrying the specific [fluid] under glass, in case some loss in its transfer should prevent the same effect of the vaccinations that were accomplished with some children in the presence of other professors of the Proto-medical Tribunal of this capital."" <br>""My plans being frustrated in this matter, I resorted to requesting it from the cows of this country, or from some native or introduced smallpox that was needed.  In spite of the extreme diligence this was given, I had the grief of seeing my hopes dashed a second time. However, they were rekindled upon receiving the royal order that Your Excellency forwarded to me with the date of September 1st of the year just past. We have been waiting impatiently for the arrival of the expedition that the paternal love of His Majesty deigned sent to these kingdoms under the care of the Honorary Doctor of the Court, Don Francisco Balmis. Because of that, I have not ceased in my anxieties for these overseas possessions, in which I have known that this benefit would be established."" <br>""In this situation, the frigates of war called the ‘Anfitrite’ and the ‘de la O,’ coming from Havana, arrived at the Port of Veracruz carrying the said material. At that time Professor Don Florencio Pérez Comoto arranged to have some little vials of the fluid delivered to me by special carrier, as here confirmed, and afterwards various vaccinated persons arrived, who were sent to me by the appreciable devotion of that government. This resulted in my gratification that the pus from Comoto’s remittance should take root in five children from the orphanage of this capital, manifesting that a few good seeds of the vaccine should be able to spread to others and extend throughout the kingdom in good time and sufficient quantity."" <br>""In this season I arranged to publicly bring my youngest son [Vicente], who is twenty-one months of age, to the said home [Home of Abandoned Children] to undeceive the public as much as possible from the misgivings that are regularly inspired by such novelties, and to effectively comfort many principal persons and families so that through his example, the rest would subject their little children and adult persons to the vaccination, to the end that in that day there should be a considerable number of those vaccinated with happy results, no only in this city, but in that of Veracruz and its provinces, and in other places where the vaccination will be propagated within a very short time in all of this district."" <br>""I believe that this notice will be very gratifying to Our August Sovereign for his pious heart and for his paternal love of his vassals, as it provides the realization of his royal intentions, as also Your Excellency, whose devotion to the happiness of the people is notorious, as it acknowledges the gentile dominion of His Majesty. Attached to this notice, Your Excellency, the supplement to the newspaper of this capital is being sent. It individualizes the successes, promising me that all will merit the royal approbation."" <br>And, I enclose it to Your Excellency, thinking that it will also be very gratifying to you devotion to receive this interesting notice directly. <br>God keep Your Excellency many years.

At the feet of the Reverend Father Minister for His Majesty of Tumacácori, who is charged with the spiritual dominion of the Royal Presidio of Tubac, be it known that, having appeared before me in this, my ecclesiastic jurisdiction, José Miguel Tierro, an Indian originally from Guasavas and a soldier of the named presidio, a widower in his first marriage to Carmen Tisnado and son of Agustín Tierro and María Paula Quesada, under mandate of Our Holy Mother Church, has asked to contract marriage with María Jesús Grijalva, a single coyota, originally from Bacoachi but now residing in this city.  She is the daughter of José Luis Grijalva and María Guadalupe Barrios. According to the deposition made by the applicant they will be parishioners of Your Reverence. In the name of Our Holy Mother Church it is exhorted and required, and on my part, I beseech you to proceed with formalities incumbent upon us by the Holy Council [of Trent] and advise me of their results and their concession for me to be able to legally perform the wedding as requested.
Always at your service. Given in Arizpe on February 8, 1803.

Friar Narciso Gutiérrez, Apostolic Father, Chaplin, and minister of the Presidio of Tubac.
In view of the foregoing request, I proceeded to obtain the information for which it asked by reading the proclamation on three consecutive holidays in all solemnity: the first day, February 20th, the Sunday before Lent (Quinquagesima); the second, February 24th, the day of Saint Matthew, Apostle; and the third, the 27th of the same month, the Sunday of the beginning Lent (Cuaresma).

He was not content with having abused his authority and command in bringing the major part of the Pimas to the point of riot and insurrection, nor was he content with having set the time and method by which it would be accomplished, but he, himself, also conspired to execute its cruelties.  In his village of Sáric on the afternoon of November twentieth, the actual day the uprising began because the Indians had already become restless because of what they planned to do that night.  In order to conceal their scheme they set up a clamor that the Apaches were coming.  Spreading the fear that the said Apaches were about to attack, they helped some ten people, all of whom were women and children, into the house that belonged to Luis, claiming that they would protect and defend them there. This is what Luis promised but did not do.  Instead, upon leaving his house he locked those persons inside, even though one was his comadre [Inés Tisnado,godmother of his child], the wife of one Lauriano [Hernández Calvo], and began his treachery by setting fire to his own house to burn inside of it - which, in effect, he did burn and incinerate - those innocent persons.  The only reason he did not do the same thing to Father Juan Nentvig, Missionary of Sáric, was because this father prevented it by fleeing to Tubutama before Luis went in search of him.  And, afterwards, Luis did go looking for him to kill him in his house in Sáric.”  =  Gabriel Antonio de Vildósola Testimony, San Ignacio de Cuquiárachi, September 9, 1754  (AGI, Guadalajara 419, 3m-10, pages 13-14)  -------- ""On the 21st of November in this sad year of 1751, the upper Pimas arose on order of their pontifical leader, Luis of Sariqui, and killed the following in the various villages:  ......

She is the legitimate daughter of the legitimate marriage of Licentiate Don Juan José Tato y Anza, lawyer of this Royal Audiencia and its most illustrious college, native of the Province of Sonora, and Doña María Josefa Sirila de Guero, native of this city; granddaughter by maternal (sic.) lineage of Don Manuel Estevan Tato and Doña Margarita de Anza; and by maternal lineage of Licentiate Don Nicolás Francisco de Guero, who was a lawyer of this Royal Audiencia, and Doña Michaela Sanchez de Pro. Her godmother was Doña María Rita Valladolid, resident of Mexico, whom I advised of her obligation.  = Manl de Omaño (rubric)  =  D.or Manl  Ignacio Soto Maior (rubric)

Ademas de dar por estas personas lo que ellos por modo de comprar piden los gratifique, y porque vienieron aquí cinco Indos del dicho Río Colorado, procuré tratar los bien, darles algo y bastimentarlos, para que así contentos hayan empeño en que por este medio se logren tan dichosos cautivos, y para que ellos con nuestro amoroso trato se aficionen y dispongan para recibir el Santo Bautismo. Todas referidas piezas remití al Pitic grande* a diferentes casas principales quienes en retorno daran lo que costaron, y algo mas para emplear en cosas que puedan servir para agasajar a los Indios que acuden ahora con frecuencias, y parece se muestran tan agradecidos, que toman empeño en tratar bien a cualquier de razón que pasa en busca de estos cautivados Indios. Me pareció bautizar a estos mayores con sola una corta inteligencia que en unos días he podido darlos por medio de un instruido interprete instruido; pues aunque de tanta edad, se nota gran sencillez y voluntad sincera de recibir el Santo Bautismo, pues de todo esto han dado pruebas. Y de alejarlas algo de aquí, sobre resultar mas bien para ellos, por la mejor instrucción, y me dió para olvidar sus errores, se ataja mejor daño que las resultará huiendose a sus tierras; pues en los pocos días que están aquí se les notaba buscar ocasión para huirse, y dos que lograron, se hubieran muerto de sed, si no se asienta con ellos, y estos reparos, y otras experiencias, me hacen bautizarlos, sin esperan la competente instrucción; pues de que no tienen repugnancia a recibir nuestra Santa Fe, estoy asegurado; pues su brutal ignorancia, hace considerarlos en punto de conocimiento de alguna religión, como a niños de un año. Al referido bautizado le puse por nombre Juan Faustino, y de este como de los expresados, su padrino Marcos Mendoza, Indio soltero, sacristan y maestro de escuela, a quien advertí el parentesco espiritual y la obligación que ha contraido con todos los expresados.

I baptized them today, and I baptized another one yesterday. Furthermore, I satisfied the purchase price by giving what their captors asked for these children and, because five Indians from the Colorado River came here, in order to deal well with them, I gave them something in the way of provisions that they might be contented and have the desire to procure such fortunate captives. That way, through our gentle treatment, these children will be inspired and prepared to receive the Holy Baptism. I sent all the aforementioned captives to Big Pitic* to the homes of different principal citizens who, in return, will reimburse my cost, plus a little more to be used for things that will serve to provide a good reception for these Indians that are coming frequently now and appear to show much gratitude, that they might have the desire to deal well with any people of means who go in search of these captive Indians. It seemed appropriate to me to baptize these older children with only the little amount of knowledge I have been able to impart to them in just a few days by means of an instructed interpreter. Although they are older children, I have noted in them a great humility and sincere desire to receive the Holy Baptism and, indeed, they have given proof of all this. It will be better for them to be sent away from here for their better instruction, and I also do it so they will forget any misconceptions and to prevent the greater damage that would result from their fleeing to their own lands. Indeed, in the few days they were here, they were observed looking for an occasion to flee, and the two who succeeded would have died of thirst had we not caught up with them. These difficulties and other experiences caused me to baptize them without waiting for sufficient instruction. Indeed, I am certain that they are not reluctant to receive our Holy Faith. Their churlish ignorance dictates that they be considered the same as children of one year of age on the point of their understanding any religion.  I named the aforementioned baptized child Juan Faustino, and for him, as the others, the godfather was Marcos Mendoza, a single Indian, sacristan and school teacher, whom I advised of the spiritual relationship and the obligation he had contracted with all the aforementioned children.
